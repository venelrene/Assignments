# Assignments

Note: please do not work on these assignments until class starts!

You will fork this repository so that all of your work is done in your own account so you can have that as a record of your work.

Each night you will create an issue in this repository, assigned to yourself, for each assignment of the night. When you place the pull request you will reference each issue number in the comment. I will close the assignment issues out when I feel you have completed each task.
