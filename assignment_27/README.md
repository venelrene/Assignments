# Assignment 27
* Add an action (query_movie) and a route, to query the IMDB API based on a request parameter passed called 'title'
* Use your same code written to query the API but don't need to prompt at the command line or output to the command line.
* Use HTML in an ERB template for that action, to display the movie title, the plot, the release date, the running time, the movie poster, and hyperlink the movie title to IMDB. Note: this means you need to grab some new data from the JSON API.
* See the oblivion_screenshot.png for how it should look
* Create a new repository for this and push it up. Create an issue for this assignment, and put the URL of this new repo in that issue.
