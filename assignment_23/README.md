# Assignment 23
* Take what we did in class with the Walmart API, and expand it to include the following functionality:
* When the user searches for a product, allow the user to enter the product id (from the search results). For the product indicated, create an InvoiceItem object and add it to your Invoice object
* Add the category to the InvoiceItem
* After the user adds a product to the invoice (using your InvoiceItem class), loop and allow them to search again
* When the user hits ENTER instead of a SEARCH term or a product id, print out the same result as in Assignment 22.
