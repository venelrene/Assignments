# Assignment 21
## First

# Birthdate can be set and read.
class Person
  attr_reader :first_name
  attr_reader :last_name
  attr_accessor :birthdate
#Create a public instance method called 'name' that takes the name and sets the first name and last name instance variables.
  def 
Create a public instance method to get the user's age.

Ask the user their name as one question, but store it separately in first and last name  variables.

As you ask the user their information, create a User object.

After asking each user their information, output the user's age.

## Next

Move the functionality in your age method into a private method called, "calculateAge". This method will be called from the public age method.

Create a class variable that will count the number of users that enter in their information.
After you output the user's age, also output the number of user they are so far (using the class variable).

Loop to allow another user to enter their information. (exit when user enters \q for name). Create a User object for each user.
